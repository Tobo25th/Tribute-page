Raised in La Paternal, he had a strong musical influence thanks to his parents, who listened to Argentine rock, salsa, disco and Latin pop. His mother was a follower of artist Alejandro Sanz, and his father was a fan of bands Queen and Virus. On the other side, his brother Nahuel was a fan of Charly Garc√≠a and Luis Alberto Spinetta. During his early teens, Lombardo started to gain interest in punk rock, being a strong listener of Linkin Park, and hip-hop, thanks to Eminem and 50 Cent, which lead him to eventually start watching rap battles, which had an important underground following in Argentina.

Influenced by long-time Argentine rappers Kodigo and Tata, he start practicising freestyle with his best friends, which allowed him to gain confidence to start participating in battle competitions.Alongside this, he dropped high school due to his poor grades.
